convert_ldap.pl
Morgan Jones (morgan@morganjones.org)

General purpose script to convert ldif from one ldap schema to
another.  It can be used stand-alone to migrate an entire ldap
environment or a few users.  It is also used in selective_ldap_sync
(separate repository) to convert users as they are synchronized
between ldap environments.

Usage:
Dump the contents of the newly configured directory (Centos/Redhat/389 DS in this case):
    /usr/lib64/dirsrv/slapd-<instance>/db2ldif -s <base> -a /var/tmp/base.ldif
    or ODSEE: dsconf export --no-repl -h localhost -p port <base> /var/tmp/base.ldif
Transform the output of the old directory with this script:
    cat <old_base>_110511.20.49.38.ldif |./convert_ldap.pl > converted.ldif
Concatenate the converted old directory to the dump of the new directory.  This
    does assume that your containers were removed by convert_ldap.pl.
    cat /var/tmp/base.ldif converted.ldif > /var/tmp/o_msues.ldif
Stop slapd:
    /usr/lib64/dirsrv/slapd-<instance>/stop-slapd
Import the new data:
    /usr/lib64/dirsrv/slapd-<instance>/ldif2db -s <base> -i /var/tmp/<base>.ldif
It is normal to get a ton of errors the first few times.  If so, modify 
    convert_ldap.cf or base.ldif and repeat above.

See convert_ldap.cf for in-depth configuration options.

- most changes can be done globally or per objectclass
- omitting bases or objects
- change from one basedn or object to another
- change attribute names
